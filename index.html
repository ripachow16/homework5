    <p>Donald J Trump has given many speeches and spoke to millions of people during this campaign. Despite the criticism he has faced due to the negative remarks he has made about specific people or a specific group of people, he somehow still managed to gain a huge following. Not only the content of his speeches were criticized but also he has faced criticism for his erratic and unfocused speaking style. Many teased him by saying his vocabulary is limited and that he spoke in broken sentences while repeating things over and over again. His opponents wondered how can a man compete for presidency and convey his messages through such poor speaking skills. 
Acting as an adviser providing “intelligence” to Trump’s campaign manager on what is making him effective with people, I have reviewed his speeches and performed some analysis. From the analysis, I can say that even though Trump does have a limited vocabulary but his simple choice of words and his emphasis on negative word especially is what capturing people’s attention. He is speaking in an unsophisticated way that everyone is able to understand and he is playing on fear. He emphasizes “we” and “American” and how it’s about us the American people. Everyone else is evil and out to harm “us.” He says, immigrants are taking our jobs, making our country unsafe, and increasing crimes in “our” country. He is basically saying he will act us the savior and save the American people and put them first. He always repeats “make America great again.” So yes, even though he is not really answering questions or telling his audience how he is going to do the things he promises he keeps emphasizing that only he will put America first. A lot of people when they are disappointed in the way their life turned out, they look for escape goats. Trump is providing his audience with the scape goats and telling them, yes you are right to blame, the Mexican, the immigrants, Muslims, and other minority groups for your problems and the countries problem. He is playing on fear and giving them hope. That is his effective way of connecting and gaining support from the people.
